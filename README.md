# Voting-application
This is a basic voting application implemented using socket programming in Python. The project simulates a voting system where multiple clients can connect to a single server, cast votes, and receive live feedback about the voting results.

## Features
Single Server, Multiple Clients: Allows multiple clients to connect to a single server to cast their votes.  
Real-time Voting: Clients can vote, and the server will track the votes in real time.
Simulation: The project simulates a voting application, showcasing socket-based communication.
Extendable: Can be extended to use a database for persistent vote storage instead of hardcoded values.
Technologies Used
Python: For implementing both the client and server logic.
Socket Programming: For network communication between the server and multiple clients.
